# Instructions to Download Quantum ESPRESSO on Your Computer

**N.B. This is not for the faint-hearted! Only do this if you are very confident in your Python and terminal skills**

## Low-Effort

The easiest way to download Quantum ESPRESSO is to download [Quantum Mobile](https://quantum-mobile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a Virtual Machine that comes with all the Quantum ESPRESSO packages pre-installed as well as many other useful pieces of software such as XCrysDen.

## High-Effort

If you're adamant to download Quantum ESPRESSO directly onto your computer, you can follow this set of [installation instructions for Mac](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yVUxDdmJCpBMlcMElqw0pvsZ0Idkrtd2SpAKTrfVRvw/edit?usp=sharing).
For Windows users, you can follow these (admittedly quite sparse) [instructions on the QE website](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/user_guide/node16.html#SECTION00039400000000000000).

## Other Things to Install

Then I would recommend installying numpy, matplotlib, and scipy (see this [Getting Started page](https://wiki.max-centre.eu/index.php/Getting_Started))
And also ASE (usually `pip3 install ase` in the terminal works, but be careful because recent versions of ASE are not very backwards-compatible.)

Feel free to reach out to any one of the workshop facilitators for help at any point!
