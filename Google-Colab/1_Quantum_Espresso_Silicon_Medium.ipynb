Setting a higher cutoff energy increases the size of the basis set (plane waves) used to represent electronic wavefunctions, and controls the number of plane waves included in the calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Higher cutoff energies generally lead to more accurate results (because you are using more plane waves) but also increases computational time. For most systems, a cutoff of 25-40 Ry (340-544 eV) may be sufficient, but this can vary widely.\n"

        "The k-point sampling density specifies how many points in the [Brillouin zone](https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Materials_Science/Supplemental_Modules_(Materials_Science)/Electronic_Properties/Brillouin_Zones) are used to calculate the property we are investigating (essentially by providing an efficient means of integrating periodic functions of the wave vector in the Brillouin zone).\n",

        "This is usually done by taking a grid of k-points, often generated by methods like [Monkhorst-Pack sampling](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.13.5188)\n",

        "> The total energy of the system is the most important output of a DFT calculation, and it is obtained by numerically integrating the Hamiltonian over the Brillouin zone. The k-points are a generic way to discretize such as integral. The quality of the results heavily depends on the number of these points on the mesh-grid as well as the method generating the mesh-grid itself used in such integration. The number of points can be arbitrarily increased to increase the precision of calculations. However, the higher the number of irreducible k-points, the higher the computational cost. Therefore, finding the optimum number of k-points to determine the total energy within a specified tolerance (i.e. “converging” on the k-point mesh) is extremely important."
